### 05. What Are Template Literal Types?
Template literal types in TypeScript allow you to create dynamic string types using the syntax of template literals (like those in JavaScript). They are formed by combining literal types, unions, and interpolations to produce new string types.

#### Key Takeaways:
- Template literal types dynamically create string types by combining literal types and interpolations.
- They work seamlessly with keyof, mapped types, and unions for powerful type manipulations.
- Use cases include creating prefixed keys, string pattern constraints, and more.
