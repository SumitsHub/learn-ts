Run 'tsc --init' to generate 'tsconfig.json' file

Run 'tsc -w index' OR 'tsc --watch' to start compilation in watch mode

By default 'tsc' OR 'tsc --watch' command will look for all the '.ts' files in the current directory

Compiler Options:
1. "files": array of file names to include
2. "include": Specifies an array of filenames or patterns to include in the program. These filenames are resolved relative to the directory containing tsconfig.json file.
3. "exclude": Specifies am array of filenames or patterns to skip in the program. Default value is: 'node_modules'
