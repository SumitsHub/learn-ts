 # Class

 ## Key difference between 'interface' and "abstract class"
 - A class can implement multiple interfaces whereas a class can extend only on abstract class
 - Interface can containing only method signatures and properties without implementation
 - Abstract class can contain both method signatures (abstract methods) and method implementations.
