# React + TS App
Using TypeScript with React

## About App
- app created using 'react-swc-ts' template by 'vite' by running command `pnpm create vite my-vue-app --template vue`
- NOTE: used 'pnpm' as package manager, installed 'pnpm' using 'Chocolaty' by running command `choco install pnpm`
- You can start the app using `pnm run dev` OR `npm run dev` both works ðŸ˜Š
